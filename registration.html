      <p>Dear International Bridge Building Contest Participant,</p>

      <p>Congratulations on qualifying for the 2015 International Bridge Building Contest!</p>

      <p>We hope that you will be able to attend the event in person at the Oregon Museum of Science &amp; Industry. The date of the contest is Saturday, April 25, 2015. There will be a very fun tour of Portland bridges and a dinner event on Friday, April 24, so we hope you will be able to attend that event as well. Please explore the event website for more information about the event, including accommodations.</p>

      <p>If you are unable to attend the contest in person, you can mail your bridge (address at the end of the registration form) and it will be tested by one of the judges. Be sure to package it securely, as we are unable to perform any repairs or maintenance.</p>

      <p>All bridges for this contest MUST be constructed only from wood supplied by the committee, using any commonly available adhesive. A few points must be remembered when receiving your official wood and during construction:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>The official wood has been specially treated with an identifying dye and you should use standard woodworking precautions when working with it. <strong>The rules require that each piece of wood be identifiable as official wood.</strong> This means that you should take special care when cutting or sanding the surface so as to leave some part of the dyed original surface exposed for identification. All bridges will be inspected to ensure that only the official wood is used.</li>
        <li>The latest revision of the contest rules are available on the contest website (<a href="http://bridgecontest.phys.iit.edu/public/international/index">http://bridgecontest.phys.iit.edu/public/international/index</a>). Please read them carefully and contact Mark Wechter (<a href="mailto:mwechter@riverdale.k12.or.us">mwechter@riverdale.k12.or.us</a>) if you have any questions.</li>
        <li>A copy of the registration form is available below. <strong>The registration form must be returned to us no later than April 17, 2014.</strong> (a pdf of the form emailed to Mark Wechter at the email address above is ok) This form contains a place for you to sign and certify that you have designed and built your bridge by yourself. We will be using the information on this form for the Program, so please print legibly.</li>
        <li>Some Regional Contests allow and encourage teams to build bridges, but the International contest is for individual students. This means that we can acknowledge one member of a regional contest winning team. Please do not come as a team and expect us to bend the rules by acknowledging more than one students per bridge.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>We will be having a couple events over the weekend of the contest, including a tour of Portland bridges and dinner cruise aboard the Portland Spirit, beginning at approximately 5:00 p.m. Dinner will be free for participants and one adult chaperone. Additional dinners can be purchased through a prior arrangement. Indicate names of chaperones/guests on the registration form.</p>

      <p><strong>For legal reasons, if you are a minor (under 18) you must be accompanied by a responsible adult, or compete by sending your bridge by mail.</strong></p>

      <p>We will have the lunch and Awards Ceremony in the early afternoon, and then you will be free to explore Portland or return to your home city. Your registration will include the luncheon for you and one guest. Other guests can attend at a cost of $15 per person. Tickets will be given to you at check-in. Please mark the total number of attendees on the registration form.</p>

      <p>Information about housing, transportation and things to do and see in Portland are available on the International Bridge Contest website. Please monitor that website for any late announcements or changes.</p>

      <p>We look forward to seeing you in April and showing off Bridge City, USA!</p>
